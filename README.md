<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

An e-commerce website inspired by the amazon website.

**Core Functionalities:**

* Creating/Signing in to an account.
* Single Page Application (instant response time).
* Desktop/Mobile responsiveness.
* Adding items to cart.
* Making payments.
* Storing of user information for individual accounts.

**Unmet Deliverables:**

* Search functionality not implemented

Although it doesn't emulate all the functionalities of the real website, it definitely maintains most of them. It is an outstanding project usable on all devices, detects signed in users and so on. It is also built with REACT & REDUX! I hope you'll love it. Click [here](https://ecommerce-react-d6unh06if-fatouuuu.vercel.app/) to see the project live on the web.
